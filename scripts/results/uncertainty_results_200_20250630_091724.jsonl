The age of the youngest Japanese driver.\n2. The name of this youngest driver.\n\n### SQL Query Analysis\nThe provided SQL query is:\n```sql\nSELECT dob, max(dob) FROM drivers WHERE nationality = 'Japanese'\n```\n\nLet's analyze this query step by step:\n\n1. **SELECT Clause**: The query selects `dob` and `max(dob)`. The `dob` (date of birth) is a field in the `drivers` table that represents the date of birth of each driver. The `max(dob)` function is used to find the maximum date of birth, which corresponds to the youngest driver because a more recent date of birth means a younger age.\n\n2. **FROM Clause**: The query retrieves data from the `drivers` table, which contains information about drivers, including their date of birth (`dob`) and nationality.\n\n3. **WHERE Clause**: The query filters the results to include only those drivers whose nationality is 'Japanese'.\n\n### Issues with the Query\n1. **Name of the Youngest Driver**: The query does not retrieve the name of the driver. The question specifically asks for the name of the youngest Japanese driver, but the query only retrieves the date of birth (`dob`) and the maximum date of birth (`max(dob)`).\n\n2. **Correctness of `max(dob)`**: The use of `max(dob)` is correct to find the youngest driver based on the date of birth. However, to get the name of the driver, additional fields such as `forename` and `surname` should be included in the `SELECT` clause.\n\n3. **Grouping and Aggregation**: The query does not use a `GROUP BY` clause, which is not necessary in this context because we are interested in a single aggregated result (the youngest driver). However, without selecting the name, the query is incomplete.\n\n### Corrected Query\nTo correctly answer the question, the query should include the driver's name (both `forename` and `surname`) along with the date of birth. Here is a corrected version of the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT forename, surname, dob\nFROM drivers\nWHERE nationality = 'Japanese'\nORDER"}}}}}
