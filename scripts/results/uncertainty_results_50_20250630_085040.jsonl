This aligns with the requirement to focus on this specific district.\n\n4. **Filtering for Charter Schools:**\n   - The query includes a condition `T1.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1`, which filters for charter schools. The column `Charter School (Y/N)` in the `frpm` table is used to identify charter schools, where a value of 1 indicates a charter school.\n\n5. **Correctness of Logic:**\n   - The logic in the query correctly combines the conditions to ensure that only charter schools in the specified district are selected.\n   - The INNER JOIN ensures that only records with matching `CDSCode` in both tables are considered, which is necessary to obtain the `Zip` from the `schools` table.\n\n6. **Assumptions:**\n   - It assumes that the `CDSCode` is a unique and correct identifier for joining the two tables.\n   - It assumes that the `Charter School (Y/N)` column correctly identifies charter schools.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe SQL query correctly implements the logic to retrieve the zip codes of charter schools in the \"Fresno County Office of Education\""}}}}}
